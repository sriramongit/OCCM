# 📌 RankWise - Online College Counseling Model (OCCM)

## 🎯 Project Overview

**RankWise** is a **fully frontend-based Online College Counseling Model (OCCM)** built using Vanilla JavaScript. This is my **first project from scratch** after learning JavaScript, and it's a hands-on attempt to simulate the real-world seat allotment process used in college counseling.

The project demonstrates how seats are allotted to candidates based on their ranks, preferences, and seat availability. The user-friendly interface (UI) will allow users to **customize input data** like candidate names, ranks, and available courses to visualize how the online counseling and seat allotment process works.

While this project is currently frontend-only, I plan to expand it into a full-stack application in the future after I learn backend technologies like Node.js.
