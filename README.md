# 📌 RankWise - Online College Counseling Model (OCCM)

## 🎯 Project Overview

**RankWise** is a **fully frontend-based Online College Counseling Model (OCCM)** built using Vanilla JavaScript. This is my **first project from scratch** after learning JavaScript, and it's a hands-on attempt to simulate the real-world seat allotment process used in college counseling.

The project demonstrates how seats are allotted to candidates based on their ranks, preferences, and seat availability. The user-friendly interface (UI) will allow users to **customize input data** like candidate names, ranks, and available courses to visualize how the online counseling and seat allotment process works.

While I am making this project frontend-only, I plan to expand it into a full-stack application in the future after I learn backend technologies like Node.js.

Please note that I have just started working on this project, i have only made the basic rankwise seat alloting algorithm in js till now, but there's still so much of work left. However you can clone this repo, customize the data using javascript and render it on your browser's console to get an idea about how the algorithm works.
